# Air Quality Analysis for Carbon Monoxide
This project aims to analyze air quality data, focusing on carbon monoxide, a prominent air pollutant. The dataset encompasses information from over 200 monitoring sites, identified by state, county, city, and local site names. Employing effective sampling techniques, the analysis seeks to uncover insights into carbon monoxide levels across various locations. Through thorough data processing and statistical analysis, we aim to identify patterns and trends within the dataset. The results will contribute to a better understanding of air quality dynamics, facilitating targeted strategies for pollution control and environmental management.
